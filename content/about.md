Hi, my name is Jorrit Gorseman. I'm a scrum master based in the Netherlands.

I'm passionate about helping teams become more effective and efficient, and improving software development processes.

I graduated with a Master of Arts from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland in 2020. Philosophy, crazily enough, helps a lot with logical thinking in creating software.

I'm a big fan of all things quality, whether in music, film or books. Some of my current favourites:

Movies:

- Arrival
- Lord of the Rings Extended Edition
- Blade Runner 2049

Music:

- Jungle
- Kaytranada
- Kendrick Lamar
- Harry Nilsson
- Childish Gambino

Books:

- The Goldfinch
- Red Rising trilogy
- Project Hail Mary

I also like board games, runnning, weightlifting, writing (see blog).

Have a great day!
