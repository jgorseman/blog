Hi, my name is Jorrit Gorseman. I'm currently based in the Netherlands.

I'm passionate about making software engineers more productive and improving processes.

I graduated with a Master of Arts from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland in 2020. Philosophy, crazily enough, helps a lot with logical thinking in creating software.

Here's a selection of a few things I like:

Movies/Series:

- Arrival
- The Lord of the Rings
- Blade Runner 2049
- Silo
- True Detective
- Chernobyl
- Love, Death + Robots

Music:

- Kaytranada
- Kendrick Lamar
- Harry Nilsson
- Childish Gambino
- Zero 7
- RÃ¶yksopp

Books:

- The Secret History (Donna Tartt)
- The Red Rising Trilogy (Pierce Brown)
- Dark Matter, Recursion (Blake Crouch)

I also like to go bouldering, running, and traveling.
