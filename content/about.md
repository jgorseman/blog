Hi, my name is Jorrit Gorseman. I'm a software tester currently based in the Netherlands.

I'm passionate about making software engineers more productive and improving test and software development processes.

I graduated with a Master of Arts from the University of Aberdeen in Scotland in 2020. Philosophy, crazily enough, helps a lot with logical thinking in creating software.

I'm a big fan of all things quality, whether in music, film or books. Some of my current favourites:

Movies:

- Arrival
- Lord of the Rings Extended Edition
- Blade Runner 2049

Music:

- Kaytranada
- Kendrick Lamar
- Harry Nilsson
- Childish Gambino

Books:

- The Goldfinch
- Red Rising

I also like to go bouldering, running, and traveling.

Have a great day!
