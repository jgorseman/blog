*I recommend skipping this post if you still want to see the film Arrival. Spoilers ahead.*

“If you could see your life from beginning to end, would you change  anything?”

The protagonist of the film *Arrival,* by learning the language of aliens who came to earth, learns to see the world in a different way. The plot of the film is based on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, which can be explained simply as the idea that *language shapes reality.* The language we learn determines how we see the world, and by learning the language of the aliens, the protagonist learns to see time in a non-linear fashion. In other words, she begins to see into the future.

What makes the film special, is not just that we see how good the protagonist is at figuring out how to communicate with aliens, it is that the transition she undergoes is deeply personal, and we see her have visions of how her future self has a baby that grows up and dies from a rare disease while still a child. Even though the protagonist knows that her future child will die from a rare disease, her choice stays the same. Not to want differently, not to fight the future, but to accept it completely, to be okay with what it brings, even though that might be suffering and pain. To choose any differently would be to avoid life itself.

It’s been said that the biggest flaw of humanity is our inability to think long-term, to figure out what is best for us on a longer timescale. Be that as it may, life is a series of choices and lessons, and figuring out how to make do with what we have is one of the challenges of life. Humanity decided to depart from resigning to fate a long time ago, and instead figured out how to manipulate the environment to their advantage. They have come a long way in their journey to eradicate suffering from life.

The balance, however, is in discerning the necessary suffering from the unnecessary. Because even though we think that pain is better to be avoided, certain kinds of pain are inevitably linked to a good life. Grief and heartbreak are part of a well-lived life and create depth, a contrast to the times of joy and contentment. A good life should contain a full spectrum of emotions, because while being satisfied in life is great, it is dissatisfaction that moves us forward. It is discontentment that makes us strive, that makes us want to improve the world.

In the end, discerning the necessary from the unnecessary suffering  and trying in our lifetime to learn to deal with the necessary and help eradicate the unnecessary suffering is the best we can do. We cannot control what happens to us, but we can control how we react to it, and resisting, fighting that which already happened only brings unnecessary suffering. While things could have gone differently, and learning to deal with whatever happens is a reward in itself. Trying to resist and avoid all pain in life is to avoid life itself, and so to live well, we can do best to love the inevitable. *Amor Fati.*
