"If X happens, then I'll be happy."

When we grow up, we unconsciously train ourselves to be happy based on certain conditions. We think our happiness is dependent on some event or achievement in the future, and think it will magically unlock the happiness we've been waiting for.

When that event finally arrives, however, we do not suddenly become happy. Perhaps we feel some amount of relief or pleasure based on this event that happened or that achievement we got, but not the kind of happiness, the _enduring satisfaction_ we were waiting for. And so we shift our expectations to another goal, another time, another achievement.

We could go our entire lives without realising that the expectations we have will never be met. This is not because the world is some depressing, hostile place that will never make us happy, it's because our expectations themselves are the root of the problem.

Our expectations come from wanting things to be different than they are. And when we always want things to be different, we will never feel satisfied with the way things are now.

You could argue that not being satisfied is what drives us to improve, but happiness and growth aren't polar opposites. In fact, they can go hand in hand. We can feel the way we want to feel and do the things we want to do if we realise that the expectations we cling to may actually prevent us from getting the things we want.

Instead of accepting what happens, we resist it. We criticize others, criticize events, we criticize our feelings, and even our own thoughts, because none of it is aligning with our expectations of how life should be. We want to resist because resisting feels like we are doing something useful about our unmet expectations.

What if we try to notice the resistance, the feeling that something _should_ be different than it is, and ask ourselves: What if I were to accept it instead?
