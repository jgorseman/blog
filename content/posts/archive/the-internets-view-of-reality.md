Whenever you read something online, know that that represents a single view.

If you come across that same perspective more than once, those having that perspective have just become a vocal minority.

The vast majority of people won't have that perspective, nor will they write about it.

Only those perspectives that are considerably positive or negative are written about; the middle is just not interesting enough.

On top of that, negative perspectives are written about and shared more easily than positive ones; people are loss averse and fear and anger incite much more participation than someone sharing a positive experience at the grocery store.

The internet should have a warning before you enter it: "Caution, the internet's view of the world is much different and more extreme than it really is, and may not reflect reality in any shape or form."
